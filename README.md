# Nintendo Badge Arcade secure

The NEX secure server for Nintendo Badge Arcade.

## Current status

Currently, the secure server is able to create a new account, but trying to access the catchers after the first time makes the console *crash*. There is a temporary fix available [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/nex-protocols-common-go/pull/4), which solves the issue.  

## Credits

The codebase of the server is based on Pretendo Network's [Super Mario Maker secure](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/super-mario-maker-secure) server.
